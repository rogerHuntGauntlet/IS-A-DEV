                <h3>AI-Powered Philosophy: Accelerating Wittgenstein Research ü§ñüìö</h3>
                <div class="post-date">March 31, 2024</div>
                <p>Exciting news! I've been leveraging AI tools to accelerate my philosophical research on Wittgenstein's work. This project demonstrates how AI can transform traditional academic research by automating time-consuming tasks while maintaining scholarly rigor.</p>

                <h4>Project Overview üéØ</h4>
                <p>I'm developing a novel transactional reading of Wittgenstein's later philosophy, exploring how his concepts of language games and forms of life can be understood through a pragmatic lens. The research is available in two forms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>GitHub Repository: <a href="https://github.com/rogerHuntGauntlet/Second-Brain/tree/ba127e2504f0606ad94513301ac95f5ab6b3041c/Witt-Trans" target="_blank" style="color: #FF6B6B; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">View the complete research codebase</a></li>
                    <li>Working Papers:
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zgc_bE1X1zJLCEInT1pAKrL0xU7QMWmorUlbhJZuJdw/edit?usp=drive_link" target="_blank" style="color: #FF6B6B; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">The Case for a Transactional Reading</a></li>
                            <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VYYf6uNm1iPI97fJduXIwLI1PItDMg7CEuU8En2__eE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style="color: #FF6B6B; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">Bentley - Focused Proposal</a></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>How AI is Transforming Academic Research üöÄ</h4>
                <p>Using AI tools has revolutionized my research workflow in several ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Automated text analysis of Wittgenstein's works to identify patterns and connections</li>
                    <li>AI-assisted literature review and synthesis of secondary sources</li>
                    <li>Smart organization of research materials and notes</li>
                    <li>Enhanced translation assistance for German texts</li>
                    <li>Rapid drafting and revision of academic arguments</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>The Future of AI in Academia üîÆ</h4>
                <p>This project isn't just about using AI to speed up traditional research methods‚Äîit's about reimagining how academic work can be done. By automating the more mechanical aspects of research, we can focus more energy on novel interpretations and creative theoretical work.</p>

                <p>Check out the GitHub repository to see how I'm organizing this research, or dive into the working papers to see the results. I'll be updating these regularly as the project develops!</p>

                <h3>Saturday Brunch: Fueling the AI Revolution! üç≥</h3>
                <div class="post-date">March 30, 2024</div>
                <p>Even AI engineers need to eat! This morning, we took a break from coding to enjoy an absolutely incredible brunch spread. When you're working 100-hour weeks, you've got to make those breaks count!</p>

                <div class="blog-images">

                </div>

                <h4>Brunch of Champions üèÜ</h4>
                <p>Today's menu was nothing short of spectacular:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Savory bacon and egg casserole</li>
                    <li>Sweet and gooey cinnamon roll casserole</li>
                    <li>Decadent French toast casserole</li>
                </ul>

                <p>There's something special about sharing a meal with fellow developers who are all working towards the same goal. These moments of connection and relaxation are just as important as the intense coding sessions - they're where we recharge, share ideas, and build the relationships that make this journey so memorable.</p>

                <h4>Back to Building! üíª</h4>
                <p>With our batteries recharged and our bellies full, it's back to work on OHFtok! Haven't tried it yet? Download our Android app from the link in the header and join the revolution in social video! We can't wait to see what you'll create.</p>

                <h3>Recap: TikTok App, AI Innovations, and the Gauntlet Journey</h3>
                <div class="post-date">March 27, 2024</div>
                <p>Over the last few days, our journey has taken an exhilarating turn. We now boast a fully functional TikTok clone, complete with project-based scrolling and a community-driven approach to collecting and sharing videos. But this isn't your ordinary clone; we're integrating plans for AI-powered features like video mashing and meme engines to transform the familiar doomscrolling experience into something creative and collaboratively engaging!</p>

                <h4>Innovation on the Tech Front</h4>
                <p>On the technical side, we're diving into the depths of Stable Diffusion and exploring complex mapping techniques to build next-level AI creation tools. Our ambition? To enable a powerful suite of AI functionality that redefines the way we interact with video content.</p>

                <h4>Collaboration & Challenges</h4>
                <p>Meetings have been buzzing with energy ‚Äì we recently connected with the team from Windsurf, whose tool offers a fresh perspective similar to Cursor. There's even a hint of a hidden nitro button waiting to be discovered! Meanwhile, on my dev side, I'm stuck in versioning hell with Flutter/Android. I'm trying to guide the AI through the process instead of coding myself, and it's as frustrating as it sounds.</p>

                <h4>Milestones & Exciting Prospects</h4>
                <p>Amidst all of this, we achieved a major milestone: our domain <a href="https://is-a.dev" target="_blank" style="color: #FF6B6B; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">is-a.dev</a> has been approved! Adding to the excitement, we recently met with students from Alpha School in Austin. Their wildly innovative approach to education has them pitching creative, AI-first app ideas ‚Äì and there's real potential for us to build some of these concepts!</p>

                <p>And yes, while I didn't contribute any artwork myself (self-centered and not that talented), a huge shout-out to Abraham for his stellar illustration!</p>

                <h3>The Future is Now: Danielle Rios's Bold Vision for AI Education üöÄ</h3>
                <div class="post-date">March 26, 2024</div>
                <p>"In five years, we won't be talking about 4-year CS degrees anymore." These powerful words from Danielle Rios sent shockwaves through the room today as she laid out her revolutionary vision for GauntletAI and the future of technology education. In a talk that felt more like a glimpse into the future, Rios challenged everything we thought we knew about learning computer science.</p>

                <h4>100-Hour Weeks: The Price of Revolution üî•</h4>
                <p>When Rios spoke about GauntletAI's infamous 100-hour work weeks, you could feel the intensity in her voice. "This isn't about grinding," she emphasized, "it's about compression of time and acceleration of learning." In an AI-first world, where tools can multiply our productivity by 10x or even 100x, she argued that traditional educational timeframes are becoming obsolete. The program's intensity isn't just about quantity‚Äîit's about immersing yourself in the future before anyone else gets there.</p>

                <h4>Disrupting the Ivory Tower üèõÔ∏èüí•</h4>
                <p>The most audacious part of Rios's vision? The claim that GauntletAI's 100-day program could replace what Stanford and MIT teach in 4 years. Here's why she believes it's possible:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Traditional CS theory is being revolutionized by AI‚Äîwhat took months to learn can now be mastered in days</li>
                    <li>Real-world projects trump theoretical knowledge in an AI-first world</li>
                    <li>The speed of technological change means shorter, more intensive learning cycles are more valuable</li>
                    <li>AI tools are becoming so powerful that learning to leverage them effectively is more important than traditional programming</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>The Great Software Disruption üåä</h4>
                <p>But perhaps the most fascinating part of Rios's talk was her analysis of AI's impact on the broader technology landscape. "We're not just replacing developers," she declared, "we're replacing entire software businesses." She painted a picture of a near future where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Legacy software companies will face unprecedented disruption from AI-first alternatives</li>
                    <li>Small teams leveraging AI will outperform traditional companies with hundreds of developers</li>
                    <li>The ability to work with AI will become more valuable than traditional coding skills</li>
                    <li>New business models will emerge that were previously impossible without AI</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Personal Reflection üí≠</h4>
                <p>Sitting in that room, watching Rios map out this bold future, I couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and vertigo. We're not just learning to code differently‚Äîwe're part of a movement that's redefining what's possible in technology. The 100-hour weeks suddenly make perfect sense: we're not just building software, we're racing to be part of the first wave of AI-native developers who will reshape the industry.</p>

                <p>As Rios concluded her talk with a challenge to "build things that make today's impossible tomorrow's ordinary," I looked around the room and saw the same fire in everyone's eyes. We're not just here to learn‚Äîwe're here to be part of a revolution. And if Rios is right (and I'm betting she is), the future belongs to those who can embrace this new paradigm first.</p>
